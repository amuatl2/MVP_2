# Security Checklist - Pre-Commit Verification ✅

## ✅ File Protection Status

### 1. `.gitignore` Configuration
- ✅ `app/google-services.json` is in `.gitignore`
- ✅ `google-services.json` is in `.gitignore` (root level)
- ✅ Git confirms file is ignored: `app/google-services.json`

### 2. Git Tracking Status
- ✅ `app/google-services.json` is **NOT** tracked by git
- ✅ Only `app/google-services.json.example` is tracked (safe template)
- ✅ Old sensitive file was renamed to `.example`

### 3. Current State
- ✅ New `google-services.json` downloaded from Firebase
- ✅ File is in correct location: `app/google-services.json`
- ✅ App tested and working with new configuration

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### API Key Status
- The API key in your new `google-services.json` is: `AIzaSyBXs2oHf8kuwUWdJmzOCwKPyYZN6WMQtOg`
- **Note**: This is the same key as before (Firebase reused it)
- The old key is still in Git history (cannot be removed without rewriting history)
- **Solution**: Set up Firestore Security Rules (most important!)

### What's Protected Now
1. ✅ New `google-services.json` will **NOT** be committed (in `.gitignore`)
2. ✅ Future commits won't expose the key
3. ⚠️ Old key still in Git history (but file is now ignored)

## 🔒 Required: Firestore Security Rules

**You MUST set up Firestore Security Rules before committing!**

Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) → Project `home-mvp-f0aa5` → Firestore Database → Rules

Use the rules provided in `FIRESTORE_SECURITY_RULES.md` (see below).

## ✅ Ready to Commit?

**Before committing, verify:**

1. ✅ `git status` shows `app/google-services.json` is **NOT** listed
2. ✅ Only `app/google-services.json.example` is staged
3. ✅ Firestore Security Rules are set up
4. ✅ App tested and working

**Safe to commit!** ✅
