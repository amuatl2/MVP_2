# Bug Fixes & Firebase Integration Summary

## Bugs Fixed

### 1. ✅ Messages Not Persisting
**Problem**: Messages sent in tickets were not saved between sessions.

**Fix**: 
- Added `Message` data model to `Ticket`
- Updated `TicketDetailScreen` to save messages via ViewModel
- Messages are now persisted in both DataStore and Firebase

### 2. ✅ Ticket Status Not Updating
**Problem**: When contractor completed a job, tenant still saw ticket as "in progress".

**Fix**:
- Fixed `saveAllTickets()` to always save all tickets (not just per-user)
- Contractors now properly save ticket updates
- All users load from the same shared ticket data

### 3. ✅ Data Not User-Specific
**Problem**: All users of the same role saw the same data.

**Fix**:
- Tickets are now shared globally (as they should be)
- ViewModel filters tickets by user role:
  - **Tenants**: See only tickets they submitted
  - **Landlords**: See all tickets
  - **Contractors**: See tickets assigned to them
- Jobs are filtered by contractor ID

### 4. ✅ Data Not Persisting Across Sessions
**Problem**: All data was lost when app restarted.

**Fix**:
- Implemented DataStore for local persistence
- Implemented Firebase Firestore for cloud persistence
- App automatically uses Firebase if configured, falls back to DataStore

## Firebase Integration

### What's Been Done

1. ✅ Added Firestore dependency
2. ✅ Created `FirebaseRepository` for all Firebase operations
3. ✅ Updated ViewModel to use Firebase when available
4. ✅ Real-time listeners for tickets and jobs
5. ✅ Automatic fallback to DataStore if Firebase not configured

### What You Need to Do

**Follow the `FIREBASE_SETUP.md` guide** to:

1. Create Firebase project
2. Add Android app
3. Download `google-services.json` and place in `app/` directory
4. Enable Authentication (Email/Password)
5. Enable Firestore Database
6. Set security rules
7. (Optional) Seed contractors data

### Current Status

- ✅ Code is ready for Firebase
- ⏳ Waiting for `google-services.json` file
- ⏳ Waiting for Firebase project setup

**The app will work with local DataStore until Firebase is configured!**

## Testing the Fixes

1. **Messages**: 
   - Login as tenant → Create ticket → Send message
   - Logout → Login as landlord → View ticket → Should see message
   - Logout → Login as contractor → View ticket → Should see message

2. **Ticket Status**:
   - Login as tenant → Create ticket
   - Logout → Login as landlord → Assign contractor
   - Logout → Login as contractor → Complete job
   - Logout → Login as tenant → Should see ticket as "completed"

3. **User-Specific Data**:
   - Login as tenant1 → Create ticket1
   - Logout → Login as tenant2 → Should NOT see tenant1's ticket
   - Logout → Login as landlord → Should see both tickets

4. **Persistence**:
   - Create ticket → Close app completely → Reopen → Ticket should still be there

## Architecture

```
┌─────────────────┐
│   ViewModel     │
│                 │
│  ┌───────────┐  │
│  │ Firebase? │  │──Yes──> FirebaseRepository ──> Firestore
│  └───────────┘  │
│       │         │
│      No         │
│       │         │
│       v         │
│  DataRepository │──> DataStore (Local)
└─────────────────┘
```

The app automatically detects if Firebase is configured and uses it. Otherwise, it falls back to local storage.
